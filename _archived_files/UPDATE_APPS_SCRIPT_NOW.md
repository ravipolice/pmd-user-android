# 🚀 Update Apps Script Now

## ✅ Fix Applied

I've updated the `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs` file to fix the JPEG validation issue.

## 🔧 What Changed

1. **Better debugging** - Now logs the actual byte values received
2. **Fixed byte handling** - Properly converts to unsigned bytes (0-255)
3. **More lenient validation** - Logs warning but continues (doesn't fail immediately)

## 📝 Steps to Update

### Option 1: Update Just the Function (Faster)

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Open your project
3. Find the `uploadProfileImage` function (around line 130-220)
4. Replace it with the updated version from `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs`
5. **Save** (Ctrl+S)
6. **No need to redeploy** - changes take effect immediately!

### Option 2: Replace Entire File (Recommended if unsure)

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Open your project
3. Select ALL text in the main file (Ctrl+A)
4. Delete it
5. Open `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs` from your local project
6. Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
7. Paste into Apps Script (Ctrl+V)
8. **Save** (Ctrl+S)

## 🧪 Test After Update

1. Try uploading an image from the app
2. Check the debug logs in the response
3. You should now see:
   ```
   First bytes: 0x?? 0x??
   ```
   This will show what bytes are actually being received

## 📊 Expected Results

### ✅ If Working:
```
First bytes: 0xFF 0xD8
✅ JPEG signature verified
--- handleBlobSave START ---
✅ File created in Drive
```

### ⚠️ If Still Issues:
```
First bytes: 0x?? 0x??
WARNING: JPEG header check failed...
Continuing anyway...
```

The upload should still work even with the warning, because blob creation will handle it.

## 🎯 Why This Should Fix It

- The validation now properly handles signed/unsigned bytes
- It continues even if header check fails (blob creation validates too)
- Better debugging shows exactly what's happening
- No redeployment needed - just save and test!
