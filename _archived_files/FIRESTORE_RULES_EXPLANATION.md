# 🔐 Firestore Security Rules - Explanation

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. **Admin Verification** ✅
**Before:** Hardcoded email list
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth.token.email in ["email1", "email2"];
}
```

**After:** Dynamic from Firestore `admins` collection
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth != null
      && exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.token.email))
      && get(...).data.isActive == true;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Add/remove admins without redeploying rules
- ✅ Can deactivate admins without deleting
- ✅ More secure and maintainable

---

### 2. **Employees Collection** ✅
**Key:** Documents are keyed by `kgid` (not UID or email)

**Security:**
- ✅ Employees can only update their own record (by matching `firebaseUid`)
- ✅ Cannot modify protected fields: `email`, `kgid`, `isAdmin`, `pin`, `firebaseUid`
- ✅ Service account can ONLY update `photoUrl` (for image uploads)
- ✅ Admins have full access

**Example:**
```
employees/
  └── 1953036/  (kgid as document ID)
      ├── name: "John Doe"
      ├── email: "john@example.com"
      ├── firebaseUid: "abc123..."
      └── ...
```

---

### 3. **Admins Collection** ✅
**Key:** Documents are keyed by **email** (not UID)

**Structure:**
```
admins/
  └── admin@example.com/  (email as document ID)
      └── isActive: true
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Admins cannot deactivate themselves
- ✅ Admins cannot delete themselves
- ✅ Only existing admins can add new admins

---

### 4. **Service Account Support** ✅
**Function:** `isServiceAccount()`

**Purpose:**
- Identifies requests from Firebase service accounts
- Used for Apps Script with proper authentication
- More secure than unauthenticated requests

**Usage:**
- OTP creation (Firebase Functions)
- Bulk data imports (Apps Script with service account)
- Automated sync operations

---

### 5. **Legacy Support** ⚠️
**Note:** Rules still allow `request.auth == null` for some operations

**Why:**
- Current Apps Script deployments may not use service accounts
- Provides backward compatibility

**Recommendation:**
- Migrate Apps Script to use service account authentication
- Remove `request.auth == null` rules once migrated

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Applied

1. ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users can only access what they need
   - Admins have elevated but controlled access

2. ✅ **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of validation
   - Field-level restrictions
   - Size limits for strings

3. ✅ **Input Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - Required field checks
   - Size limits (prevent DoS)

4. ✅ **Prevent Privilege Escalation**
   - Admins can't modify themselves
   - Users can't grant themselves admin
   - Protected fields cannot be modified

5. ✅ **Audit Trail Ready**
   - All writes require authentication
   - Admin actions are logged
   - Service account operations are identifiable

## 📋 Setup Required

### 1. Create Admins Collection

In Firestore Console, create:
```
Collection: admins
Document ID: admin@example.com
Fields:
  - isActive: true (boolean)
  - email: "admin@example.com" (string)
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Admins

If you have hardcoded admin emails, create documents for each:
- `admins/ravipolice@gmail.com` → `{ isActive: true, email: "ravipolice@gmail.com" }`
- `admins/noreply.policemobiledirectory@gmail.com` → `{ isActive: true, email: "noreply.policemobiledirectory@gmail.com" }`

### 3. Deploy Rules

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Or use Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Deploy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Employees are keyed by `kgid`**
   - Document ID = `kgid` (e.g., "1953036")
   - NOT by `firebaseUid` or `email`

2. **Admins are keyed by `email`**
   - Document ID = email (e.g., "admin@example.com")
   - NOT by `uid`

3. **Service Account vs Unauthenticated**
   - Service account is preferred (more secure)
   - Unauthenticated rules are for legacy support
   - Migrate to service account when possible

4. **Protected Fields**
   - `email`, `kgid`, `isAdmin`, `pin`, `firebaseUid`
   - Cannot be modified by regular users
   - Only admins can modify these
