# 🔀 API Router - When Do You Need It?

## ✅ Quick Answer

**You need a router ONLY if you want to deploy both services in a SINGLE Apps Script project.**

## 📊 Two Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Separate Deployments (No Router Needed) ✅

**Setup**:
- `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` → Deployed as **Project A**
- `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` → Deployed as **Project B**

**Result**:
- Each project has its own `doGet()` and `doPost()` functions
- Each project has its own deployment URL
- **No router needed** - each service handles its own routing

**Android App**:
- `ImageRepository.kt` → Uses Project A URL
- `NetworkModule.kt` → Uses Project B URL

### Scenario 2: Combined Deployment (Router Needed) ⚠️

**Setup**:
- `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` → File 1 in **Single Project**
- `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` → File 2 in **Single Project**
- `MAIN_ROUTER.gs` → File 3 in **Single Project** (Router)

**Result**:
- Only ONE `doGet()` and `doPost()` can exist per project
- Router decides which service to call based on `action` parameter
- **Router is required** to coordinate between services

**Android App**:
- Both services use the same URL
- Router handles routing internally

## 🎯 Which Should You Use?

### Use Separate Deployments (No Router) ✅ **Recommended**

**When**:
- Production environment
- Want independent scaling
- Want to update services separately
- Want separate permissions/access

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No router needed
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Independent updates
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ Can scale independently

**Setup**:
1. Deploy `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` as separate project
2. Deploy `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` as separate project
3. Update Android app with both URLs
4. **Done! No router needed**

### Use Combined Deployment (With Router) ⚠️

**When**:
- Development/testing
- Want single URL to manage
- Small project
- Don't need independent scaling

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single URL
- ✅ Shared configuration
- ✅ Easier for small projects

**Drawbacks**:
- ⚠️ Router needed
- ⚠️ Both services must be updated together
- ⚠️ Single point of failure
- ⚠️ Harder to debug

**Setup**:
1. Create Apps Script project
2. Add `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` as File 1
3. Add `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` as File 2
4. Add `MAIN_ROUTER.gs` as File 3 (Router)
5. Deploy as single Web app
6. Use one URL for both services

## 📝 Router File Structure

If you choose combined deployment, your Apps Script project should have:

```
📁 Your Apps Script Project
  ├── IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs          (from IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs)
  ├── EMPLOYEE_SYNC.gs         (from EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs)
  └── MAIN_ROUTER.gs           (NEW - routes requests)
```

**Important**: 
- Remove `doGet()` and `doPost()` from `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs` and `EMPLOYEE_SYNC.gs`
- Keep only the router's `doGet()` and `doPost()` in `MAIN_ROUTER.gs`
- Router calls functions from both files

## 🔧 Router Implementation

The router (`MAIN_ROUTER.gs`) does this:

```javascript
function doPost(e) {
  const action = e.parameter.action;
  
  if (action === "uploadImage") {
    return uploadProfileImage(e);  // From IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs
  }
  
  return handleEmployeeApi(e);    // From EMPLOYEE_SYNC.gs
}
```

## ✅ My Recommendation

**Use Separate Deployments (No Router)** because:
1. ✅ No router needed - simpler
2. ✅ Better architecture
3. ✅ Independent updates
4. ✅ Easier maintenance
5. ✅ Production-ready

**Only use router if**:
- You specifically want a single URL
- You're doing development/testing
- You have a very small project

## 📋 Decision Tree

```
Do you want separate URLs for each service?
├─ YES → Separate Deployments → NO ROUTER NEEDED ✅
└─ NO → Combined Deployment → ROUTER NEEDED ⚠️
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Separate (Recommended - No Router)

1. Deploy `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` → Get URL 1
2. Deploy `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` → Get URL 2
3. Update Android app with both URLs
4. **Done!**

### Option B: Combined (Router Required)

1. Create Apps Script project
2. Paste `IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.gs` → Remove `doGet`/`doPost`
3. Paste `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_COMPLETE.gs` → Remove `doGet`/`doPost`
4. Paste `MAIN_ROUTER.gs` → Keep `doGet`/`doPost`
5. Deploy → Get single URL
6. Update Android app with single URL
7. **Done!**

## 🎯 Summary

- **Separate deployments**: No router needed ✅
- **Combined deployment**: Router required ⚠️
- **Recommendation**: Use separate deployments (no router)

The router file (`MAIN_ROUTER.gs`) is provided if you choose combined deployment, but **you don't need it for separate deployments**.
