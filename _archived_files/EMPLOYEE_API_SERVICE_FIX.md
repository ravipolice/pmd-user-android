# Critical Fix: EmployeeApiService Retrofit Configuration

## 🐛 Issue Found

**Problem**: Employee cards were not showing in the app despite 987 records being synced to Firestore.

**Root Cause**: The `EmployeeApiService` was configured to use the **wrong Retrofit instance**:
- ❌ **Was using**: `DocumentsRetrofit` (points to documents upload URL)
- ✅ **Should use**: `SyncRetrofit` (points to employee sync URL)

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/example/policemobiledirectory/di/NetworkModule.kt`

**Change**: Updated line 108 to use the correct Retrofit instance

### Before (Incorrect):
```kotlin
@Provides
@Singleton
fun provideEmployeeApiService(@Named("DocumentsRetrofit") retrofit: Retrofit): EmployeeApiService =
    retrofit.create(EmployeeApiService::class.java)
```

### After (Correct):
```kotlin
@Provides
@Singleton
fun provideEmployeeApiService(@Named("SyncRetrofit") retrofit: Retrofit): EmployeeApiService =
    retrofit.create(EmployeeApiService::class.java)
```

## 🔍 Why This Matters

### Retrofit Instances in NetworkModule.kt:

1. **`SyncRetrofit`** (✅ Correct)
   - Base URL: `EMPLOYEES_SYNC_BASE_URL`
   - URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxBKIOzMZmCTpgQnmUlr0Hg-mWkZcQjIoryfq7C_jJ0fl5KtbJV0axxv4XnmcUuoqCs3w/`
   - Purpose: Employee data sync (Sheet ↔ Firestore)
   - Used by: `SyncApiService`, **`EmployeeApiService`** (after fix)

2. **`DocumentsRetrofit`** (❌ Wrong for employees)
   - Base URL: `DOCUMENTS_BASE_URL`
   - URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby-7jOc_naI1_XDVzG1qAGvNc9w3tIU4ZwmCFGUUCLdg0_DEJh7oouF8a9iy5E93-p9zg/`
   - Purpose: Document/file uploads
   - Used by: `DocumentsApiService` only

### Impact of the Bug:

When the app tried to:
- Fetch employee data via `EmployeeApiService.getEmployees()`
- Add/update/delete employees
- Perform any employee operations

It was calling the **wrong Google Apps Script URL** (documents URL instead of employee sync URL), resulting in:
- ❌ 404 errors or invalid responses
- ❌ Employee data not loading
- ❌ Employee cards not showing

## 📱 What This Fixes

After this fix, `EmployeeApiService` will:
- ✅ Call the correct employee sync URL
- ✅ Successfully fetch employee data
- ✅ Display employee cards in the app
- ✅ Allow add/update/delete operations to work

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the app** with this fix
2. **Test employee loading** - employees should now appear
3. **Verify employee operations** - add/update/delete should work
4. **Check app logs** if issues persist

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After rebuilding:
- [ ] Employee cards appear in the app
- [ ] Employee data loads correctly
- [ ] Employee search works
- [ ] Employee filters work
- [ ] Employee add/update/delete operations work

## 📊 Related Configuration

**EmployeeApiService endpoints** (now correctly pointing to employee sync URL):
- `GET exec?action=getEmployees` - Fetch employees
- `POST exec?action=addEmployee` - Add employee
- `POST exec?action=updateEmployee` - Update employee
- `POST exec?action=deleteEmployee` - Delete employee

**SyncApiService** (already correctly configured):
- Uses `SyncRetrofit` ✅
- Handles `syncSheetToFirebase` and `syncFirebaseToSheet` actions

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - EmployeeApiService now uses the correct Retrofit instance
