# 🚀 Quick Fix: Use Embedded Upload Version

## The Problem
You're still getting HTML error even after adding `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs`. This suggests the file might not be in the project or there's a deployment issue.

## ✅ Solution: Use Single File Version

I've created `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs` which has **everything in one file**. This eliminates the "missing file" issue.

### Step 1: Copy to Apps Script

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Open your project
3. **Delete all existing files** (or backup them first)
4. Create **ONE new file**: `Code.gs`
5. Copy the **entire contents** of `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs`
6. Paste into `Code.gs`
7. **Save** (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)

### Step 2: Verify Function Exists

1. In Apps Script editor, click the function dropdown (top right)
2. Type "uploadProfileImage"
3. If it appears → ✅ Function exists
4. If it doesn't appear → ❌ Check the file was saved

### Step 3: Deploy as Web App

1. Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**
2. Click the gear icon ⚙️
3. Select **Web app**
4. Configure:
   - **Execute as**: `Me (your-email@gmail.com)`
   - **Who has access**: `Anyone` ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
5. Click **Deploy**
6. **Authorize** if prompted
7. **Copy the Web app URL**

### Step 4: Test

Open the URL in browser. Should see:
```json
{"error":"No parameters. Use ?action=..."}
```

If you see HTML, deployment is wrong.

### Step 5: Update Android App

Update the URL in `GDriveUploadService.kt` to match your new deployment.

## ✅ Why This Works

- **Single file** = No missing file issues
- **All functions in one place** = No import/access problems
- **Same functionality** = Everything still works
- **Easy to debug** = All code visible in one file

## 🔄 Later: Separate Files (Optional)

Once it's working, you can:
1. Split into `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_FINAL.gs` and `IMAGE_UPLOAD.gs`
2. But for now, use the single file version to get it working
