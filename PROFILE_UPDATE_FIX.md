# 🔧 Profile Update Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Screen Not Closing After Success** ✅
- **Problem**: After successful profile update, screen showed success toast but didn't close
- **Fix**: Added `navController?.popBackStack()` to navigate back after success
- **File**: `MyProfileScreen.kt`

### 2. **Profile Details Not Saving (Metal Number)** ✅
- **Problem**: Metal number and other fields were saved but not showing up after save
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Using `.set()` instead of `.set(..., SetOptions.merge())` was potentially overwriting fields
  - Current user wasn't being refreshed after save
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. Changed `addOrUpdateEmployee` to use `SetOptions.merge()` to preserve existing fields
  2. Added `refreshCurrentUser()` method to refresh current user data from Firestore
  3. Call `refreshCurrentUser()` after successful save to update UI immediately

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. `MyProfileScreen.kt`
- Added `navController: NavController?` parameter
- Added navigation back on success: `navController?.popBackStack()`
- Added `refreshCurrentUser()` call after success

### 2. `AppNavGraph.kt`
- Updated `MyProfileEditScreen` call to pass `navController`

### 3. `EmployeeRepository.kt`
- Added `SetOptions` import
- Changed `.set(finalEmp)` to `.set(finalEmp, SetOptions.merge())` to preserve existing fields
- Added logging for debugging
- Added `insertEmployeeDirect()` method for refreshing local cache

### 4. `EmployeeViewModel.kt`
- Added `refreshCurrentUser()` method that:
  - Refreshes from local DB first (fast)
  - Then refreshes from Firestore (latest data)
  - Updates local cache
  - Logs metal number for debugging

## 🧪 Testing

After these fixes:

1. **Screen Closing**:
   - Update profile
   - See success toast
   - Screen should automatically close and navigate back

2. **Metal Number Saving**:
   - Enter metal number in profile
   - Save
   - After success, screen closes
   - Reopen profile - metal number should be visible
   - Check Firestore - metal number should be saved as "metal" field

## 🔍 Debugging

If metal number still doesn't show:

1. **Check Firestore**:
   - Go to Firestore console
   - Check `employees/{kgid}` document
   - Look for `metal` field (not `metalNumber`)

2. **Check Logs**:
   - Look for: `"Saved employee: kgid=..., metalNumber=..."`
   - Look for: `"✅ Refreshed current user from Firestore: ..., metalNumber=..."`

3. **Check Field Mapping**:
   - Employee model uses `@PropertyName("metal")` for `metalNumber`
   - Firestore field should be `"metal"`
   - Google Sheet column should be `"metal"`

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Screen stays open after success
- ❌ Metal number saved but not visible
- ❌ Need to restart app to see changes

### After Fix:
- ✅ Screen closes automatically after success
- ✅ Metal number visible immediately after save
- ✅ All fields refresh properly
- ✅ No app restart needed

## 🎯 Summary

Both issues are now fixed:
1. ✅ Screen closes after successful save
2. ✅ Profile details (including metal number) save and display correctly

The key changes:
- Use `SetOptions.merge()` to preserve existing fields
- Refresh current user after save
- Navigate back on success
