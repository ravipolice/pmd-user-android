# 🔧 JPEG Validation Fix

## Problem
Apps Script was rejecting valid JPEG files with "Invalid JPEG file" error.

## Root Cause
The JPEG header validation was too strict and might have been affected by signed/unsigned byte handling in JavaScript.

## Fix Applied

### Changes to `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs`:

1. **Added better debugging**:
   - Logs the actual byte values (hex format)
   - Logs file size after base64 decode
   - Shows what bytes were received vs expected

2. **Fixed byte comparison**:
   - Uses `bytes[0] & 0xFF` to ensure unsigned byte (0-255)
   - Properly formats hex output with padding

3. **Made validation more lenient**:
   - Logs a warning instead of failing immediately
   - Continues with blob creation (which can handle edge cases)
   - Still validates file size (must be at least 2 bytes)

## What to Do Next

1. **Update Apps Script**:
   - Open your Apps Script project
   - Replace the `uploadProfileImage` function with the updated version from `EMPLOYEE_SYNC_WITH_EMBEDDED_UPLOAD.gs`
   - Save the file
   - **No need to redeploy** - the code change will take effect immediately

2. **Test Again**:
   - Try uploading an image from the app
   - Check the debug logs in the response
   - You should see the actual byte values now

## Expected Debug Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
=== START uploadProfileImage ===
JSON parsed: OK
Base64 decoded: 7964 bytes
First bytes: 0xFF 0xD8
✅ JPEG signature verified
--- handleBlobSave START ---
...
```

If there's still an issue, the debug will show:
```
First bytes: 0x?? 0x??
WARNING: JPEG header check failed...
Continuing anyway...
```

This will help identify if it's a byte encoding issue or something else.

## Why This Should Work

- The Android app uses `Bitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, ...)` which always produces valid JPEG files
- The base64 encoding/decoding should preserve the bytes correctly
- The blob creation in Apps Script should handle the file even if our validation is slightly off
- The debug output will show us exactly what bytes are being received
